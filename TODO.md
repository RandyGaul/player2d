* Use the editor to place tile sprites around, and make a nice screen-sized scene
* Manually edit the map.txt file to place slopes/boxes over the tile sprites
* ~~Add a button to toggle on/off the debug rendering~~
* [STRETCH GOAL] Place some dynamic boxes with the crate art, so the hero can push them around
* [STRETCH GOAL] Get the project running in browser via emscripten. I actually started this, but had to deprioritize the idea since I got stuck properly initializing GLES3.
